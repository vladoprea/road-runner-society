# ROAD RUNNER SOCIETY

I choose to create a presentation site for an association that I started 10 years ago with some of my friends. Its main activity is based in a rural area in the North of Romania called Valea Chioarului in Maramures County.
Road Runner Association has the mission to promote artistic and cultural experiment as a lifestyle and support sustainable and responsible development in the rural areas. Most of the association projects and actions focus on rural revival through educational, touristic and cultural events.

## UX

The site has a simple and logic structure and it is easy to navigate. I planned it more like a presentation site with a single call to action for the possibility of volunteering. It is targeted more for the people who have already a few informations about the association.

### Structure and Design objectives

- to present the scope and mission of the association aswell as some of the fields of interest and activities

- to make a written and visual description of the area where the association developed most of its projects. Also, to show the impact that these actions had to Durusa village, its basecamp

- to provide description, details and status of the running projects

- to make a short brief of the most longevive project of the association with a 10 years history: Durusa Summerhills festival

### User Stories

- As a new visitor, I want to easily navigate and find clear and simple written and visual information
- As a participant at the festival, I want to find out more about the association activity
- As a company owner, I want to find out if our fields of interests are the same and to make a first contact
- As a possible volunteer, I want to have a more general view of the association and a posibility to sign in for a volunteering session.

## Features

### Existing features

At the top of each page, on the left, there is a logo linked to the Home page and on the right a responsive navigation bar with four buttons. For mobile devices I used a toggle button. At the bottom of each page there is a footer with two social links, contact details and copyright. On smaller than medium devices the items go one on top of each other.

#### Home

Home button contains the first page of the site. Content is structured in 3 parts. The first two consists in a picture each and text that describes the scope and mission of the association and makes a short introduction to the village. The third part is an album carousel with pictures from the village. On smaller than medium devices, content goes one on top of each other, starting with the picture.

#### Projects

Projects button contains information about three ongoing projects of Road Runner. Each of them is structured in a section that contains a represantative picture, name, text about, a project status with a progress bar and a button that opens a modal. Modal contains a form and it gives the oportunity to the user to apply for volunteering. On smaller than medium devices, each of elements of the section goes on top of each other in this order: image, text, project status, button.

#### Summerhills

Summerhills button contains information about the most succesfull project. It has three sections, first with a picture, title and some short description of the event. Also, here can be found a button with a link that goes to a separate site for the festival. Second and third sections contain a video each and a description text.

#### Contact

Contact button has a simple structure. It contains a screenshot for a map that shows the location of the village, contact details like adress, phone number and e-mail and a form contact.

### Features left to implement

- an alert that opens a page with the latest informations regarding projects
- a Shop page that will contain for sale items made by the members of the association. Money raised through this shop will support projects
