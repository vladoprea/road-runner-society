#ROAD RUNNER SOCIETY

I choose to create a presentation site for an association that I started 10 years ago with some of my friends. Its main activity is based in a rural area in the North of Romania called Valea Chioarului in Maramures County.
Road Runner Association has the mission to promote artistic and cultural experiment as a lifestyle and support sustainable and responsible development in the rural areas. Most of the association projects and actions focus on rural revival through educational, touristic and cultural events.

##UX
The site has a simple and logic structure and it is easy to navigate.
