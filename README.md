# ROAD RUNNER SOCIETY

I choose to create a presentation site for an association that I started 10 years ago with some of my friends. Its main activity is based in a rural area in the North of Romania called Valea Chioarului in Maramures County.
Road Runner Association has the mission to promote artistic and cultural experiment as a lifestyle and support sustainable and responsible development in the rural areas. Most of the association projects and actions focus on rural revival through educational, touristic and cultural events.

## UX

The site has a simple and logic structure and it is easy to navigate.

### Structure and Design objectives

- to present the scope and mission of the association aswell as some of the fields of interest and activities

- to make a written and visual description of the area where the association developed most of its projects. Also, to show the impact that these actions had to Durusa village, its basecamp

- to provide description, details and status of the running projects

- to make a short brief of the most longevive project of the association with a 10 years history: Durusa Summerhills festival

### User Stories

- As a new visitor, I want to easily navigate and find clear and simple written and visual information
- As a participant at the festival, I want to find out more about the association activity
- As a company owner, I want to find out if our fields of interests are the same and to make a first contact
- As a possible volunteer, I want to have a more general view of the association and a posibility to sign in for a volunteering session
